# MS-Project---SAP-ERP-Rollout-Example
SAP ERP Rollout for an Imaginary LubricantCo. PetroNova
Description: “End-to-end SAP S/4HANA Migration Project Plan with MS Project”
Tools Used: Microsoft Project,Excel, etc.
Key Skills Demonstrated: WBS & scheduling, Resource and cost planning, Risk Register and management, Milestone tracking and baselining, Integration with PMO reporting

Through this project example, I have tried to demonstrate the project flow for any IT implementation project. In past two decade, I have rolled out several business related digitalization and improvement projects, delivered substantial bottom line value and improved business performance.

**This Example demonstrate summary of End-to-End Project planning, workflow of Project deliverables**

Comprehensive End-to-End Planning: Expert in building and managing complex project schedules from initiation to closure, including detailed WBS development, task decomposition, and critical path analysis for large-scale programs (SAP S/4HANA, ERP rollouts, and infrastructure migrations).

Dependency & Constraint Management: Skilled at mapping and managing complex task dependencies, lead/lag times, and constraints to accurately model project sequencing, identify schedule risks early, and proactively manage delivery timelines.

Resource Planning & Cost Control: Advanced use of the Resource Sheet, standard rates, resource leveling, and utilization tracking to optimize workforce allocation, manage team workload, and control labor costs across multi-functional delivery teams.

Baseline, Variance, and Performance Tracking: Strong capability in setting baselines, tracking progress, and performing variance analysis to monitor schedule performance (SPI/CPI) and forecast delivery outcomes.

Critical Path & What-If Scenarios: Skilled at analyzing and communicating the critical path, running “what-if” schedule simulations, and optimizing delivery plans to reduce risk and accelerate time-to-value.

Milestone-Driven Reporting: Expert in designing milestone-based schedules and leveraging milestone trend analysis for executive reporting, steering committee dashboards, and governance reviews.

Cost and Budget Management: Proficient in building time-phased cost models, integrating cost data with schedule performance, and producing earned value metrics (EV, PV, AC) to support financial forecasting and PMO reporting.

Integrated Resource & Calendar Management: Experienced in managing multiple calendars, resource capacity constraints, and working/non-working day configurations to reflect real-world project conditions.

Change & Baseline Control: Experienced in applying schedule change control processes — managing baseline rebaselines, tracking change requests, and quantifying schedule impact for transparent governance.

Communication & Stakeholder Reporting: Expert at customizing views, filters, and reports (Gantt charts, burndown, milestone reports) and integrating MS Project data into executive dashboards for clear and actionable communication.

Portfolio-Level Planning: Proficient in managing interdependent workstreams, linking multiple projects, and using master/sub-project structures for enterprise-level program delivery.

Advanced Import & Integration: Skilled at integrating MS Project with Excel, Power BI, and other PM tools for consolidated reporting, and importing/exporting data for cross-platform collaboration (e.g., ProjectLibre, JIRA).
